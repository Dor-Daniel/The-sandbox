# The Sandbox — Experiments in Code, Math & Art

---
A personal collection of small experiments, sketches, and side projects exploring the intersection of mathematics, graphics, and creativity.

This repository serves as a living notebook of ideas; from p5.js generative sketches to C++ and Java mini-games, to shader experiments and other short, focused explorations.

Each project inside this repository started as a question:

“What happens if I try to implement this concept myself?”

## Overview

#### This repo collects independent mini-projects that I created to explore different topics such as:

- Graphics programming and visual simulations

- Procedural generation and creative coding

- Geometry and mathematical visualization

- Game design and small algorithmic mechanics

Most of these were built to learn and understand something new — not necessarily to finish a full product.

## Repository Structure

    the-sandbox/
    ├── README.md



*Each folder contains its own small README (or notes) with short explanations and images. docs/images/ holds preview screenshots and GIFs for the main gallery below. Projects are intentionally lightweight and self-contained — easy to open, read, and run.*

## Featured Mini Projects

### Below are some of my favorite experiments.

(More coming soon…)

**I frequently add new experiments when exploring a concept in math, graphics, or simulation.**

## Learning Themes

Across these projects, I explored:

- Geometry and transformations (rotations, scaling, matrices)

- Procedural algorithms (noise, randomness, fractals)

- Simulation design (particles, flocking, physics)

- Shader programming (GLSL, lighting models, distance fields)

- Creative visualization of abstract concepts

*Each project represents a snapshot of curiosity — a focused exercise in learning something by building it.*

## How to Explore

#### Each folder contains:

- A small README with setup/run instructions

- Source files and assets

- Screenshots or GIFs under /docs/images/

#### Examples:

- p5.js sketches can be opened directly in the browser

- Java projects use a single Main.java or .jar for quick testing

- Shader files can be viewed in ShaderToy
 or any GLSL viewer

- C++/Raylib experiments can be built with g++ or Visual Studio 

## Philosophy

**“I write code to explore — not to finish.”**

These projects are born from *the joy of revealing hidden structures in the mathematical universe through code.*

Each experiment is a *small journey into the harmony between logic and beauty;* where equations become patterns, and algorithms turn into art.

I don’t code to polish or complete; I code to discover, to watch mathematics unfold visually, and to experience the quiet satisfaction of understanding something infinite through something finite.

## Future Additions

- New p5.js sketches on fractals and chaos systems

- Small Unity physics toys

- Procedural texture generator

## Closing Thoughts

**This space is an invitation.**
To pause the distinction between science and art, and enter a world where logic breathes beauty and mathematics paints.

*Each line of code here is not a product, but a lens; a way to glimpse the quiet order behind what seems chaotic.
It’s a place for anyone who wishes to see equations as colors, algorithms as compositions, and computation as a language of wonder.*
