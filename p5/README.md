# p5.js Sketches

This directory collects my ongoing explorations in mathematical art, visual intuition, and generative coding using p5.js
.

**Each sketch here started as an idea, a question, a curiosity, or just a search for beauty in patterns.**

Feel free to open any file, tweak parameters, and watch new structures emerge.

*“Mathematics becomes art the moment you stop calculating and start wondering.”*

|  2  | **Kind of Three-Body Simulation**               | A stylized gravitational dance inspired by the chaotic motion of three bodies.          |
|  3  | **Line Movement to Rotation Appearance**        | Converts linear oscillations into rotational symmetry through motion mapping.           |
|  4  | **Linear Transformations Visualizer**           | Interactive visual exploration of 2D matrix transformations on geometric shapes.        |
|  5  | **Lotus Creation Animation**                    | Generates blooming, recursive lotus-like patterns using parametric equations.           |
|  6  | **Mandelbrot Set Generation**                   | Iterative rendering of the Mandelbrot set — zoomable and parameterized.                 |
|  7  | **Molds Simulation**                            | Organic growth algorithm simulating diffusion-like expansion of virtual molds.          |

|  9  | **Periodic Functions Generation Using Circles** | Builds periodic waveforms by summing rotating circles (Fourier-like synthesis).         |
|  10 | **Sierpinski Triangle – Deterministic**         | Classic recursive Sierpinski fractal drawn using deterministic subdivision.             |
|  11 | **Sierpinski Triangle – Random**                | Chaos-game approach to generating Sierpinski triangles via random iteration.            |
|  12 | **String Art – Picture Copy (Greedy)**          | Reconstructs images with straight lines connecting circular pegs in a greedy algorithm. |
|  13 | **Visualize Functions While Rotating Axis**     | Dynamic visualization of function graphs rotating through space to reveal 3D symmetry.  |

##  Notes

**All sketches use p5.js and run in any modern browser.**

You can modify constants at the top of each script to experiment with parameters like speed, iteration depth, and color.

Some sketches are purely artistic; others visualize mathematical or physical systems.

*Enjoy!*
